## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This project will take information from a user for creating a roofing estimate for a homeowner.  It will also produce an order form for the supplier and a cost sheet to measure profitability.  It will be able to have several users who can log in to make, save, and edit estimates.
I was in roofing sales for 7 years and most companies use generic software for estimating that is incomplete, they can't personalize it, and is limited in its functionality.  
### Features
User Login - Users will have their own page with their estimates listed, but also have access to all estimates.

Create - Users will be able to create, edit, and save estimates.

Search - Users will be able to search estimates

### Technologies
Technologies will include Python, Flask, MySQL, SQLAlchemy, Jinja Templates

### What I'll Have to Learn
For this project I will learn JavaScript 1) to be able to add a Google maps view of the address on the estimate and 2) to make the front- end more interactive.

### Project Tracker
I will be using Pivotal Tracker
